				<h1>Upgrading Hazel</h1>
			</div>
				<p>The recommended method of upgrading is to use the built-in updating system. It's easy and trouble-free.</p>
				<div summary="How to upgrade Hazel" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To use Hazel's automatic update system:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>Go to the "Info" section.</li>
<li>If you would like Hazel to check for updates automatically, check the "Check for Updates" options and select how often you would like Hazel to check.</li>
<li>If you would like to check for an update now, click the "Check Now" button</li>
<li>When Hazel checks for an update, it connects to the Noodlesoft site. The only information it transmits is the version you are currently running. This is used to tailor the release notes appropriately.</li>
<li>If an update is found, Hazel will present you with release notes on the new release and ask if you would like to download and install it.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to upgrade at this time, you can click "Remind Me Later". Hazel will remind you based on your automatic update settings.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to upgrade to this version, you can click "Skip This Version". Hazel will not remind you of an update until another version has been released.</li>
<li>If you do wish to upgrade, Hazel will download, unpack and install the upgrade for you. This will require a restart of System Preferences after which you are ready to go.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>
				<br/>
<p>If you'd like, you can check the "Include anonymous system profile" option to send your system profile whenever you check for updates. This is totally optional and voluntary. Click on the "More Info&#8230;" button to learn more about this option.</p>
				
				<p>If you are upgrading from a version of Hazel before 1.1 (previous versions do not have the automatic update system), the following procedure will ensure a clean upgrade. Note that all settings and rules will be carried over.</p>
				<div summary="How to upgrade Hazel" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To upgrade Hazel manually:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>Start up System Preferences or if it already running, click on the "Show All" button up top.</li>
<li>Control-click on the Hazel icon.</li>
<li>Select "Remove 'Hazel' Preference Pane".</li>
<li>Quit System Preferences.</li>
<li>Install Hazel as outlined in <a href="installing.html">"Installing Hazel"</a>.</li>
						</ol>
