				<h1>Rule Reference Manual</h1>
			</div>
<p>This section describes all the different file attributes and actions that are available in the Hazel rule interface.</p>

<br/>
<h1>File Attributes</h1>
<br/>

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>This is the file's name, without the extension. So, if you have a file called "example.jpg", this attribute would match against "example".</dd>

<dt>Extension</dt>
<dd>This is the file's extension, which is the part of the file name after the last dot ("."). The file "example.jpg" would have an extension "jpg". Note that if you have Finder hide extensions, then the extension may not be visible to you.</dd>

<dt>Full Name</dt>
<dd>This represents the full name of the file, which is the name plus the extension.</dd>

<dt>Date Added</dt>
<dd>This is the date when the file was added to the current folder. This attribute is useful for determining how long a file has been sitting in a particular folder.</dd>

<dt>Date Created</dt>
<dd>This is the date the file was created.</dd>

<dt>Date Last Modified</dt>
<dd>This is the date the file was last changed.</dd>

<dt>Date Last Opened</dt>
<dd>This is the date the file was last opened.</dd>

<dt>Date Last Matched</dt>
<dd>The date when the file last matched a rule and had its actions successfully run against it. This attribute is useful for cases where you want to specify "since last time></dd>

<dt>Kind</dt>
<dd>This indicates the type of file, such as a movie or a folder. Selecting "Other" as a kind will bring up a list of all the available file types on your system.</dd>

<dt>Tags</dt>
<dd>This is a list of tags that can be assigned to a file.</dd>

<dt>Color Label</dt>
<dd>This is the color label, if any, set on the file. This will match any of the tags which are currently associated with the color.</dd>

<dt>Comment</dt>
<dd>This is where you can add your own notes to a file. You can edit these comments in Finder via the "Get Info" option.</dd>

<dt>Size</dt>
<dd>This is the size of the file. This is the actual size of the file which may be less than the amount of space it takes up on disk.</dd>

<dt>Contents</dt>
<dd>The text content of the file. If specifying "contain/do not contain", you can match any words that Spotlight has indexed for this file. In a nutshell, if you can find the file via Spotlight using a certain word, that word will be contained in the file's contents.<br/><br/>
If using "contain match/do not contain match", you can match against a pattern, and optionally grab text so that it can be used in your actions. For more details on creating match patterns, see <a href="editingMatchPatterns.html">Editing match patterns</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Source URL/Address</dt>
<dd>This is the URL or email address the file came from. Note that only certain programs store this information, such as Safari and Apple Mail.</dd>

<dt>Subfolder Depth</dt>
<dd>How many folders deep, starting from the folder being monitored. This is only useful if there is a rule set up to descend into subfolders using the "Run rules on folder contents" action. A subfolder depth of 0 indicates the top level folder (the one Hazel is set to monitor).</dd>

<dt>Sub-file/folder Count</dt>
<dd>How many files/folders are contained by the folder being processed. This only counts the number of items immediately underneath the folder, not those contained in subfolders of this one. If the current item being processed is a file, then this will always be zero. This is similar to Spotlight's "Number of Items" attribute except that this does not include hidden files in the count.</dd>

<dt>Passes AppleScript</dt>
<dd>Allows you to provide an AppleScript to evaluate the file. For details on writing AppleScript for Hazel, see <a href="writingAppleScript.html">Writing AppleScripts</a></dd>

<dt>Passes shell script</dt>
<dd>Allows you to provide a shell script to evaluate the file. See <a href="writingShellScripts.html">Writing Shell Scripts</a> for more information.</dd>

<dt>Any File</dt>
<dd>This attribute matches all files. This is useful for use in the last rule in a list to apply to any files that do not match any of the previous rules.</dd>

<a name="SpotlightAttributes"></a>
<dt>Other</dt>
<dd>This attribute will allow you to select any Spotlight attribute in the system. Once selected, you can filter on the attribute as if it were one of Hazel's built-in attributes.</dd>
</dl>

<br/>
<h1>Actions</h1>
<br/>

<dl>
<dt>Move</dt>
<dd>This moves the file/folder to the specified destination folder. The "Throw away if duplicate" option specifies whether you want the item to be thrown away if it already exists at the destination. If an item with the same name exists at the destination folder and it is not a duplicate, you can specify whether a number should be added to the end of the name, that the new item should replace the old one, or the new one thrown away in favor of the old one. You can also specify that some of the folder structure be copied over as described in <a href="folderStructure.html">Copying folder structure</a>. This action will fail if the source and destination folders are the same.</dd>

<dt>Copy</dt>
<dd>This copies the file/folder to the specified destination folder. If copying a folder, the folder and all its contents (and all its contents' contents and so on) are copied. The "Do not copy if duplicate" option specifies whether you want the file to not be copied if it already exists at the destination.  If an item with the same name exists at the destination folder and it is not a duplicate, you can specify whether a number should be added to the end of the name, that the new item should replace the old one, or to keep the old one. You can also specify that some of the folder structure be copied over as described in <a href="folderStructure.html">Copying folder structure</a>. This action will fail if the source and destination folders are the same. Note that subsequent actions in the same rule apply to the copy and not the original.</dd>

<dt>Rename</dt>
<dd>Renames the file/folder. You can specify a pattern to use for the renaming. See <a href="editingPatterns.html">Editing patterns</a> on how to edit the pattern.</dd>

<dt>Sort into subfolder</dt>
<dd>Sorts an file/folder into a subfolder based on a specified pattern. If the folder does not exist, it will be created as needed. See <a href="editingPatterns.html">Editing patterns</a> on how to create the pattern. Note that you can indicate additional levels of folders by using the &#x25B8; token. Also, the "anything" attribute (&hellip;) can be used to match against partial names of existing folders. When using this, keep in mind that the folder cannot be created for you.</dd>

<dt>Sync</dt>
<dd>Syncs the file/folder to the destination. This is similar to copy but it will only copy those files that have changed. Note that the sync is one-way. Files changed at the destination will not get copied back.</dd>

<dt>Upload</dt>
<dd>Uploads the file/folder to a server. Uploads can be done via FTP, SFTP, and WebDAV. Hazel will ask for your login credentials (if you do not have these, ask the server's administrator) and then connect, allowing you to choose a destination folder. Your credentials will be securely stored in your keychain so that Hazel can log in without prompting when the rule runs. You can also specify that some of the folder structure be copied over as described in <a href="folderStructure.html">Copying folder structure</a>.</dd>

<dt>Add tags</dt>
<dd>Adds tags to the file/folder. You can also add Dynamic Tags where the tags are created on the fly based on file metadata and custom attributes you create. See <a href="editingPatterns.html">Editing patterns</a> for more details on how to use patterns to create Dynamic Tags.</dd>

<dt>Remove tags</dt>
<dd>Removes the specified tags from the file/folder. You can have all the tags on a file removed by using the special “any existing tags” item. You can also specify Dynamic Tags where the tags are created on the fly based on file metadata and custom attributes you create. See <a href="editingPatterns.html">Editing patterns</a> for more details on how to use patterns to create Dynamic Tags.</dd>

<dt>Set color label</dt>
<dd>This sets the color label on the file/folder. Select the "X" if you want the color label to be removed. This sets the all tags associated with the given color and will remove any other colored tags from the file.</dd>

<dt>Add comment</dt>
<dd>This adds a comment to the file/folder which is searchable via Spotlight. If you include the "Comment" attribute in your pattern, it will include the pre-existing comments in your new comment, otherwise the pre-existing comment will be replaced.</dd>

<dt>Toggle extension</dt>
<dd>This sets whether the file's extension is hidden or visible.</dd>

<dt>Archive file</dt>
<dd>Converts the file/folder to a zip file. This is the same type of archive you would get using the "Compress" feature in the Finder. Note that subsequent actions in the same rule will operate on this new archive; the original item is put in the Trash.</dd>

<dt>Unarchive file</dt>
<dd>If the file is an archive, the file is unpacked. Note that subsequent actions in the same rule will operate on the unpacked file/folder; the original archive file is put in the Trash. This action will fail if the file is not an archive.</dd>

<dt>Open file</dt>
<dd>Opens a file. You can specify a specific application or use "Default Application" to open the file with the application that would normally open it when you double-click on it. Some caution should be exercised when opening files from untrusted sources; structure your rule conditions appropriately. Also, if you use this action, you should disable any browser options that will cause it to open files otherwise you may end up with files opening twice.</dd>

<dt>Show in Finder</dt>
<dd>Opens a new Finder window with the file/folder selected.</dd>

<dt>Make alias</dt>
<dd>Creates an alias to the file/folder in the specified folder. Aliases are useful as shortcuts to other files.</dd>

<dt>Import into iTunes</dt>
<dd>Imports the file into iTunes. The file itself is not moved anywhere so depending on your iTunes settings, you may want to  move it to its proper place beforehand (if you have iTunes set to not copy files) or throw it away afterwards (if you have iTunes set to copy files). Note that iTunes will be launched if it is not already running.</dd>

<dt>Import into Photos</dt>
<dd>Imports the file into Photos. The file itself is not moved anywhere so depending on your Photos settings, you may want to  move it to its proper place beforehand (if you have Photos set to not copy files) or throw it away afterwards (if you have Photos set to copy files). Depending on your Photos preferences, Photos may or may not copy files it imports. Note that Photos will be  launched if it is not already running.</dd>

<dt>Import into iPhoto</dt>
<dd>Imports the file into iPhoto. The file itself is not moved anywhere; iPhoto copies files it imports. Therefore, it is up to you to set up a subsequent action that moves the file where you want it. Note that iPhoto will be  launched if it is not already running.</dd>

<dt>Import into Aperture</dt>
<dd>Imports the file into Aperture. You can specify the folder or project to import the file into. You can also tell Aperture to copy/move/leave the file when importing. Note that Aperture will be  launched if it is not already running.</dd>

<dt>Run AppleScript</dt>
<dd>Allows you to trigger an AppleScript. For details on writing AppleScript for Hazel, see <a href="writingAppleScript.html">Writing AppleScripts</a>.</dd>

<dt>Run Automator workflow</dt>
<dd>Automator actions can also be triggered by rules. Make sure your Automator workflow takes a file as input.</dd>

<dt>Run Shell Script</dt>
<dd>Runs a shell script or any command-line program. See <a href="writingShellScripts.html">Writing Shell Scripts</a> for more information.</dd>

<dt>Run rules on folder contents</dt>
<dd>This causes Hazel to run the full rule list on the files and folders contained in this one. You should make sure you have a condition specifying "Type is Folder" as this action will fail if run on a file. If sub-folders match a rule with this action, Hazel will continue to descend as needed. Be careful about allowing Hazel to descend too far as this will delay processing of subsequent files. For more information, see <a href="descendingIntoFolders.html">Processing subfolders</a></dd>

<dt>Continue matching rules</dt>
<dd>This tells Hazel to continue matching against subsequent rules instead of stopping. Normally Hazel will stop once it finds a match but this will indicate that rule evaluation should continue. Note that you cannot continue evaluation if the file is moved out of its folder. Therefore, you cannot use this action in conjunction with the Move and Sort into Subfolder actions.</dd>

<dt>Display notification/Display Growl notification</dt>
<dd>This action allows you to display a notification on screen. You can even set a sound to be played, accessible when clicking the options button.<br/><br/>
See <a href="editingPatterns.html">Editing patterns</a> on how to edit the pattern.</dd>

<dt>Ignore File</dt>
<dd>This action does nothing. It is useful for ensuring that certain files do not get processed. For instance, you can set a rule at the beginning of a list to exclude certain files from any subsequent rules. This action only makes sense when it is the only action in a rule.</dd>
