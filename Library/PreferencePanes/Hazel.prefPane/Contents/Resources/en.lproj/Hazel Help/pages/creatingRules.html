				<h1>Creating a rule</h1>
			</div>
				<p>The rule interface is where you tell Hazel how to organize your files. Rules consist of two main parts, its conditions and its actions. The conditions specify which files this rule should apply to while the actions specify what Hazel should do with the matching files.</p>
				<div summary="How to create a rule" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To create a rule:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>In the "Folder"  pane, you can click the plus (+) button under the rule list to create a new rule. This will bring up the rule interface.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<li>Enter a description. This is for you to identify the rule and is what appears in the rule list.</li>
<li>Select "Any" or "All" to indicate whether you want the rule to match if at least one condition or all conditions hold true.</li>
<li>Create conditions by selecting file attributes and values. The interface will change according to the type of attribute selected.</li>
<ul>
<li>You can create more conditions clicking on the plus ("+") button at the right end of the condition.</li>
<li>You can remove conditions by clicking on the minus ("-") button at the right end of the condition.</li>
<li>For more information on creating more advanced conditions, see <a href="writingRuleConditions.html">Creating Rule Conditions</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Create actions. As with creating conditions, the plus and minus buttons add and remove actions, respectively.</li>
<li>When you are done, click "OK" to save your rule or "Cancel" to back out and throw out any changes.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>

<p>You can have Hazel give you a live preview of how your rule would match a file.</p>
				
			<div summary="How enable live preview" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To preview a rule:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>Click on the "Preview" button located above the condition list.</li>
<li>Select a file to preview against the rule. Note that since this only previews the conditions (not the actions), the file will not be modified.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>

<p>You should now see badges indicating whether the condition matches the rule. Clicking on the badge will show you the value for the attribute being matched. If you continue editing, the preview will update to keep you apprised of match status.</p>

				
<div summary="How disable live preview" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To turn off the live preview:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>Click on the "Preview" button located above the condition list. The button will become unhighlighted to indicate it is off.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
