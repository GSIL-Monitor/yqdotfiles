<br/>
<p>Hazel provides a couple options for cleaning out folders. These options throw away common files that you never really need but clutter your folders anyways.</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicate files<br/>
Duplicate files are copies of files created because they were downloaded twice or copied via the Finder. These files usually follow a naming scheme where a number is added, such as "filename-1" or "filename(1)". Hazel can be set to automatically remove these files if they are identical to the original (the version of the file without the added number).
</li>
<li>Incomplete downloads<br/>
Incomplete downloads occur when a download is aborted or interrupted. You can have Hazel throw these away automatically after a set time. Set the time period to the time after which it is very unlikely you would want to restart the download. This option is only available to folders that browsers download to.</li>
</ul>
