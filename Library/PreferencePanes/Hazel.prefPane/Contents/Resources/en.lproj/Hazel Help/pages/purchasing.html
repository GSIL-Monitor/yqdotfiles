				<p>You must buy a full license to be able to use Hazel's full feature set without any expiration time.</p>
				
				<div summary="How to purchase Hazel from the website" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To purchase a license:</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>Navigate to the "Info" pane.</li>
							<li>Click the "Purchase" button.</li>
							<li>Select which type of license you would like to buy.</li>
							<li>Fill out your payment information. Make sure your email address is valid and that your spam filters allow email from noodlesoft.com.</li>
							<li>After confirmation of your payment details, your license will be automatically downloaded and Hazel will register itself.</li>
							<li>Your receipt as well as a copy of your license file will also be emailed to the address you provided.</li>
						</ol>
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>If you would like to purchase Hazel via the website instead, click the "Go to Webstore" button. PayPal and Google Checkout orders as well as orders using a coupon code all must be done on the web.</p>
						<p>
						<strong>To purchase a license on the web:</strong></p>
						<ol>
							<li>Follow the instructions in your browser for specifying the product and entering your payment information.</li>
							<li>After confirmation of your payment details, a license file will be emailed to you. The license will come as an attachment so make sure your spam filters will not filter it out. If your spam filter has such a feature, you should add noodlesoft.com to your whitelist.</li>
							<li>Double-click the license or drag it into Hazel's window or save the license file to disk and add it via the "Add License" button.</li>
						</ol>
