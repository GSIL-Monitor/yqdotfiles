				<h1>Syncing rules</h1>
			</div>
<p>You can sync your rules to an external file, where other folders can access it. They can be shared amongst other folders on the same machine or even across machines, if the file is saved on a network file sharing service, like Dropbox or iCloud drive.</p>

<p>When rules are synced, any changes made to the rules, no matter where, will be shared across all folders synced to the same file. Only the full ruleset for a folder can be synced; you cannot specify individual rules. The active state of each rule is not synced, though. This allows you some level of customization in each folder as you can have rules that are only active in certain folders without affecting the others. If a rule is added, when synced to other folders, it will be inactive in those folders. You must mark the rule as active before it will run on that folder.</p>

<p>Note that Hazel also keeps a local cache of the rules. This allows you to continue using the rules should the sync file be temporarily unavailable, such as when you are off the network. When the sync file is available again, your rules will resume syncing.</p>

<p>To set up rule syncing, first you must set up a sync file.</p>

				<div summary="How to set up rule sync" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To set up a sync file:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>Select the folder whose rules you want to sync.</li>
<li>From the action pull-down (<img src="../gfx/action.png"/>), select "Rule Sync Options&#8230;"</li>
<li>In the rule sync interface, click "Set up new sync file&#8230;"</li>
<li>Select the new file where you want to save the rules. If you save it to a network file share/sync service, like Dropbox or iCloud drive, then the rules can be synced by instances of Hazel on other machines (as long as they are running the same service).</li>
<li>Click "Done".</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>

<p>After setting up a sync file, you should see a sync icon appear for that folder.</p>

<p>To have other folders sync with your sync file, you must set them to use an already configured sync file. Note that when doing this, any existing rules will be overwritten by the rules in the sync file.</p>

				<div summary="How to sync with another folder's rules" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To sync rules with another folder:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>From the action pull-down (<img src="../gfx/action.png"/>), select "Rule Sync Options&#8230;"</li>
<li>In the rule sync interface, click "Use existing sync file&#8230;"</li>
<li>Select the sync file you set up earlier.</li>
<li>Click "Done".</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>

<p>You should see a sync icon appear for that folder. The rules will be those from the sync file. Any changes you make will be reflected in the rules of the other folders and vice versa.</p>

				<div summary="If you need to stop syncing with other folders" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To stop syncing rules with another folder:</strong>
						<ol>
<li>From the action pull-down (<img src="../gfx/action.png"/>), select "Rule Sync Options&#8230;"</li>
<li>In the rule sync interface, click the "close" button next to the rule file.</li>
<li>Click "Done".</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>

<p>Your rules are now detached and will no longer sync.</p>
