			</div>
				<p>You can see what rules match which files in Hazel. The preview/status interface can give you a good overview of how your rules play out without running the rules, even before running the rules.</p>
				<p>If you are unsure of your rules, you may want to pause the folder temporarily and unpause it after you have previewed them and are satisfied with them. See <a href="pausingFolders">Pausing Folders</a> for more.</p>
				
				<div summary="How to view rule matches" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To view rule matches:</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>Select the folder whose rules you want to preview.</li>
							<li>Click the Preview/Status button (<img src="../gfx/preview.png"/>). The preview/status interface shows you all the items in the folder as well as which rules they match.</li>
							<li>For files that have already been run, you can see the date matched, which is when Hazel last ran and processed the file. If there is no date matched, then Hazel has not processed that file yet</li>
							<li>If there was an error processing a file, instead of the date matched, you will see the error that occurred.</li>
                            <li>You can view attributes for a file by clicking on the Info button (<img src="../gfx/optionsbutton.png" alt="options button" />). There you can also select a rule from the popup. If the rule matches, the attributes that match are highlighted blue. If it does not match, the attributes which caused it to fail are highlighted red.</li>
							<li>You can press the spacebar to bring up a QuickLook of the selected item.</li>
							<li>When you are finished viewing, click the "Done" button.</li>
						</ol>
