				<h1>Loading the sample rules</h1>
			</div>
				<p>Hazel has a set of sample rules you can load at any time. These rules provide basic filling capability as well as serving as a starting point for your own rules.</p>
				<p>When you start Hazel for the first time, you are given the opportunity to load these rules. If you opted not to load the rules at that time and you need to load them into a new folder, you can still load them yourself.</p>
				<!-- Try to keep this text short on a task page. -->

						<strong>To load the sample rules:</strong>
						<ol>

							<li>The sample rules are loaded in an active state. Enable the rules you want by clicking on the checkbox next to the rule.</li>
