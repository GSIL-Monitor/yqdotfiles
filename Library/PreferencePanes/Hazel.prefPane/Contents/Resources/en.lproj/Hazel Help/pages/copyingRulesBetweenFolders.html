				<p>In addition to importing and exporting whole rule lists, you can copy or move individual rules from one folder to another.</p>
				<div summary="How to copy a rule to another folder" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To copy a rule to another folder:</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>Click and drag the rule to copy.</li>
							<li>Drag the rule to the folder you would like to copy the rule to.</li>
							<li>If you have "spring-loaded folders" enabled in Finder's preferences, the folder will be selected if you hold the rule over the folder.</li>
							<li>Drop the rule on the folder. This will result in the rule being added to the end of the rule list for that folder. Alternatively, if you have "spring-loaded folders" enabled, you can drag the rule back to the rule list to drop it in a specific position.</li>
							<li>You can likewise move a rule by holding down the command key during the drag and drop. The green plus (+) icon will disappear in such a case.</li>
