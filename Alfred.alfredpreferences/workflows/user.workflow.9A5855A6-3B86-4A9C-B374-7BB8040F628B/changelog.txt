v1.5
24 March 2014

* New icon for DeskDrawer folder (to fit in with OS X custom folder look).
* DeskDrawer is now allowed on the Desktop itself.
* "Undo" function to reverse the last "Move" to DeskDrawer or Sweep.
* "Protect" specified Desktop items from being moved to the DeskDrawer during Sweeps.
* Fix for XML-illegal characters in filenames.
* More icons.
* Removed AlleyOop updater support.
* Default DeskDrawer location is now Home folder.
* Local documentation (keyword: **deskdrawer help**)
* Miscellaneous minor tweaks and fixes.

v1.4
2 April 2013

* New keyword - "move" - to move selected Finder items to Drawer. (Basically the same as the File Action, but just another way of doing it.)
* Changed "movedrawer" keyword to ":movedrawer" to avoid conflict with "move". Figured it's a once-in-a-blue-moon action, so doesn't need to be easily accessible.

v1.3  
1 April 2013

* New action: "fn-select" item to Trash it.
* Consolidated and tidied up workflow setup panel.
* Support for Alleyoop auto-updater (http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1582-alleyoop-update-alfred-workflows/)
* Minor cosmetic tweaks.

v1.2  
2 Feb 2013

* Added "movedrawer" functionality - choose the storage location of your DeskDrawer.

v1.1  
1 Feb 2013

* Small update to take advantage of the new "Browse in Alfred" Action, rather than doing it clunkily with Applescript.

v1.0  
30 Jan 2013

* Initial release.
