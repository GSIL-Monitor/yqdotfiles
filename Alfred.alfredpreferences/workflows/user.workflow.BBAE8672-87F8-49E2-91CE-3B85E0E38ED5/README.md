Secure SHell for Alfred
=======================

Open SSH connections from [Alfred 3][alfredapp] (only) with autosuggestions based on `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, `/etc/hosts` and your history.

!["Secure SHell Demo"][demo]
<!-- !["Secure SHell Demo"](./demo.gif) -->


Features
--------

- Auto-suggest hostnames from `/etc/hosts` and `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
- Remembers usernames, so you don't have to type them in every time. (You can also remove connections from your history.)
- Alternate actions:
  - Open SFTP connection instead of SSH.
  - Ping host.

This started as a straight port of [@isometry's][isometry] Python [SSH workflow][ssh-breathe] to Go as a testbed for the language and a Go workflow library. It has since been ported to Alfred-3 only, and gained some additional features.


Installation
------------

Download [the latest release][gh-releases] and double-click the file to install in Alfred.


Usage
-----

Keyword is `ssh`:

- `ssh [<query>]` — View and filter known SSH connections.

  - `↩` or `⌘+<NUM>` — Open the connection.
  - `⇥` — Expand query to selected connection's title. Useful for adding a port number.
  - `⌘+↩` — Open an SFTP connection instead.
  - `⇧+↩` — Ping host.
  - `⌥+↩` — Forget connection (if it's from history).

### Configuration

There are several options available in the workflow's configuration sheet. Notably, you can turn off individual autosuggestion sources.

| Variable | Description |
|---  | --- |
| `DISABLE_ETC_HOSTS` | Set to `1` to ignore `/etc/hosts`. |
| `DISABLE_KNOWN_HOSTS` | Set to `1` to ignore `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. |
| `DISABLE_HISTORY` | Set to `1` to disable the History (reading and writing). |
| `EXTERNAL_TRIGGER` | Set to `1` to re-open Alfred via an External Trigger instead of a direct AppleScript call. The External Trigger is safer, but leaves Alfred in a weird mode. |




**Please note**: The workflow simply generates an `ssh://` (or `sftp://`) URL and asks Alfred to open it. Similarly, the ping function uses Alfred 3's Terminal Command feature. If it's not opening in the right app, it's not the workflow's fault.
